    Hi,

    <p>Thanks for choosing to hire from Amherst.</p>

    {% if invoice %}
    <p>Please find your invoice attached.</p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if missing %}
    <p>Thanks for returning the hired equipment - I hope it worked well for your event.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the return was missing the following items - can you please look/check with colleagues to see if they can be recovered - otherwise we will draw up an invoice for replacement costs.</p>
    <p>MISSING KIT:</p>
    <ul>
        {% for item in missing %}
        <li>{{ item }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <p>(If you have already discussed missing items with us please disregard this automatically generated email)</p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if label %}
    <p>Please find a pre-paid Parcelforce label attached – it needs to be printed and attached to the box.</p>
    <p>Please ensure any old postage labels are removed or thoroughly obscured as otherwise the parcel may be delivered back to you instead of coming home!</p>

    {% if booking_state.direction == 'in' %}
    <p>Collection is booked from {{ booking_state.shipment_request.collection_info.collection_contact_business_name }}{{ booking_state.shipment_request.collection_info.collection_address.address_line1 }} on {{ booking_state.shipment_request.shipping_date }}.</p>
    <p>We are unable to give precise timings, however you should receive notifications by SMS and email where provided.</p>

    <p>If for any reason the courier is missed you can drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>

    <p>Please drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>
