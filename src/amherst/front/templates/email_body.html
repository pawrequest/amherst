    Hi,

    <p>Thanks for choosing to hire from Amherst.</p>

    {% if invoice %}
        <p>Please find invoice number {{ invoice.stem }} attached.</p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if missing %}
        <p>Thanks for returning the hired equipment - I hope it worked well for your event.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the return was missing the following items - can you please look/check with colleagues to see
            if they can be recovered - otherwise we will draw up an invoice for replacement costs.</p>
        <p>MISSING KIT:</p>
        <ul>
            {% for item in missing %}
                <li>{{ item }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>

        <p>(If you have already discussed missing items with us please disregard this automatically generated email)</p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if label %}
        <p>Please find a pre-paid Parcelforce label attached â€“ it needs to be printed and attached to the box.</p>
        <p>Please ensure any old postage labels are removed or thoroughly obscured as otherwise the parcel may be
            delivered back to you instead of coming home!</p>

        {% if shipment.direction == 'in' %}
            <p>Collection is booked from
                {{ shipment.collection_info.collection_contact.business_name }} {{ shipment.collection_info.collection_address.address_line1 }}
                on {{ shipment.shipping_date | ordinal_dt }}.</p>
            <p>We are unable to give precise timings, however you should receive notifications by SMS and email where
                provided.</p>

            <p>If for any reason the courier is missed you can drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>
        {% elif shipment.direction == 'dropoff' %}
            <p>Please drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

    <p>If you have any queries please let us know.</p>

    <p>Kind Regards,<br>Amherst Enterprises</p>
