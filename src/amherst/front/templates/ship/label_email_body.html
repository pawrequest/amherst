    Hi,

    <p>Thanks for choosing to hire from Amherst.</p>

    <p>Please find a pre-paid Parcelforce label attached â€“ it needs to be printed and attached to the box.</p>
    <p>Please ensure any old postage labels are removed or thoroughly obscured as otherwise the parcel may be delivered back to you instead of coming home!</p>

    {% if dropoff %}
    <p>Please drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>
    {% else %}
{#    <p>Collection is booked from {{ booking_state.shipment_request.collection_info.collection_contact_business_name }}{{ booking_state.shipment_request.collection_info.collection_address.address_line1 }} on {{ shipping_date | dt_ordinal???}}.</p>#}
    <p>We are unable to give precise timings, however you should receive notifications by SMS and email where provided.</p>

    <p>If for any reason the courier is missed you can drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>If you have any queries please let us know.</p>

    <p>Kind Regards,<br>Amherst Enterprises</p>
