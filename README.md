This project pulls together a number of different tools to assist with our day-to-day business needs.

It is ludicrously over-engineered. Previous iterations used PySimpleGui, but that is no longer FOSS, and anyway it's nice to play with a new stack.

Instead we produce a full FastAPI based web-application wrapped in FlaskWebGui to render as a desktop app.

### Commence RM Designer Edition
- get and edit data in our arcane db software
