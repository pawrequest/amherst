        <p>Thanks for returning the hired equipment - I hope it worked well for your event.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the return was missing the following items - can you please look/check with colleagues to see
            if they can be recovered - otherwise we will draw up an invoice for replacement costs.</p>
        <p>MISSING KIT:</p>
