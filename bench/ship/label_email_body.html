    Hi,

    <p>Thanks for choosing to hire from Amherst.</p>

    <p>Please find a pre-paid Parcelforce label attached â€“ it needs to be printed and attached to the box.</p>
    <p>Please ensure any old postage labels are removed or thoroughly obscured as otherwise the parcel may be delivered
        back to you instead of coming home!</p>

    {% if shipment.direction == 'dropoff' %}
        <p>Please drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>
    {% elif shipment.direction == 'in' %}
        <p>Collection is booked from
            {{ shipment.collection_info.collection_contact.business_name }}, {{ shipment.collection_info.collection_address.address_line1 }},
            on {{ shipment.shipping_date | ordinal_dt}}.</p>
        <p>We are unable to give precise timings, however you should receive notifications by SMS and email where
            provided.</p>

        <p>If for any reason the courier is missed you can drop the labelled box at any UK post office.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>If you have any queries please let us know.</p>

    <p>Kind Regards,<br>Amherst Enterprises</p>
